# TODO Someday

- Add a structured output mode for `--script` runs (e.g., JSON or TSV) to make automated grading/capture easier.
- Model subordinate-clause particles (e.g., `go/gur`, `nach/nár`) and their irregular past behaviors.
- Consider dialect toggles (e.g., Munster synthetic preferences, `do` + past particle).
